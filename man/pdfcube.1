.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBpdfcube\fP(1) is a tiny (about 30KiB) viewer for Portable Document
Format (PDF) files that adds spinning cube transition effect to your
PDF presentation files (like Compiz or Mac ones). It can also zoom on
5 predefined areas with a smooth zooming effect. This program is
suited only for landscape PDF files, mostly presentations done with
LaTeX (Beamer, Prosper, etc.) or OpenOffice.org Impress.
.PP
\fBpdfcube\fP(1) is an open source, low-effort, spare-time, money-less
project. Your help is welcome!

The "-i" option can be omitted, the first non-option string is treated
as the input file. Since the "-c" option accepts an undetermined
number of parameters it should be, if present, the last option on the
command line.
